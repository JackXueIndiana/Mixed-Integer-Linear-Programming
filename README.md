# MixedIntegerLinearProgrammingwithMILP
This is repo report how I tried out two examples with MIP.

## Problem Statement
- An integer programming problem is a mathematical optimization in which all variables are restricted to be integers.
- Integer programming is NP-complete
- If some decision variables are not discrete the problem is known as a mixed-integer programming problem.

## Existed Python Packages
- SciPy: Linear programming with solver
- Pulp: Formularizer without solver and integration with commercial solvers, such as  Gurobi
- MIP: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming with solver and integration with commercial solvers, say Gurobi.
